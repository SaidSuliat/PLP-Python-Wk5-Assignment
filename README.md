# 🧱 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class!

This repository contains my solution for **Assignment 1** where I designed my own classes in Python. The assignment is split into two parts: building a custom class and applying polymorphism.

## 📌 Overview

The assignment includes two activities:

---

## 🏗️ **Part 1: Design Your Own Class**

I designed a custom class that represents a concept of my choice. In this part, I:
- Defined a class with relevant **attributes** (properties).
- Created **methods** (functions) to interact with or modify the object's state.
- Used the **constructor (`__init__`)** to initialize objects with **unique values**.
- Implemented **inheritance** and applied concepts of **encapsulation** and **polymorphism**.

> The goal was to demonstrate an understanding of object-oriented principles by creating a class with clear functionality and relationships.

## 🎭 **Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge!**

In this activity, I implemented polymorphism by creating multiple classes that share a common method name but behave differently depending on the class type.

For example:
- **Car** and **Plane** both implement the `move()` method, but they behave differently:
  - `Car.move()` prints "Driving 🚗"
  - `Plane.move()` prints "Flying ✈️"

This demonstrates the concept of **polymorphism** by having different classes with the same method name but different implementations.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open the Python files in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Run the main Python script to see the classes and polymorphism in action!

```bash
python main.py
