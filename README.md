# OOP Assignment: Class Design & Polymorphism

This repository contains my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment for the task:
- Design a class with attributes and methods.
- Demonstrate polymorphism with vehicles and actions (move).

## Code Breakdown

### Assignment 1: Smartphone Class
- A `Smartphone` class with attributes like `brand`, `model`, `storage`, and `battery_life`.
- A `GamingSmartphone` subclass that adds more specific features like cooling system and refresh rate.

### Assignment 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- A `Vehicle` base class with a `move()` method.
- Derived classes like `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`, each implementing `move()` in its own way.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `oop_assignment.py` file in your local Python environment.

```bash
python oop_assignment.py
